# 🚀 *Contribution Guidelines for WOC 4.0*

Please read the entire guideline thoroughly. It contains answers to many common questions, so it’s important not to skip any sections. If you don’t follow these instructions and later ask a question in the Discord channel, there’s a good chance that the answer is already covered here. By overlooking this guide, you might end up asking questions that have already been answered, making your inquiry less effective.

We are excited to have you as a contributor! Please take a moment to review these guidelines. They will help you get started and ensure that the contributions are well-organized and of high quality.

# 📜 *Basic Instructions*

## **1. One Issue at a Time**

Each contributor can only be assigned to **one issue at a time**.

- After completing an issue and having your work merged, you will be free to assign yourself to a new issue.
- If you are working on an issue but wish to abandon it and work on a different one, you must first comment on the issue and wait for confirmation from the maintainer before reassignment.

## **2. Video Submission is Required**

When you create a pull request (PR), **a video submission is mandatory**. The video should demonstrate the following:

- **What your changes do**: Show the feature in action or explain how the bug fix works.
- **How you implemented it**: Provide a brief explanation of the approach you took.

This helps the maintainers understand what was changed and review your contribution. Without this video, your PR will not be merged.

## **3. Wallpaper Submission for WallGodds**

If your contribution involves adding a new wallpaper, **attach a screenshot or photo** of the wallpaper in your PR. This visual is crucial for the review process.

Without this image, your submission cannot be approved. Therefore, ensure that the wallpaper is presented clearly.

## **4. File Structure Adherence**

Our project follows a **strict file structure** to ensure consistency and maintainability. Please ensure that your files adhere to this structure when adding new content.

For example:
- When adding a new feature, ensure the code is placed in the appropriate folder, such as `Components/GalleryModule`, `Components/ErrorModule`, etc.
- If adding a wallpaper, place it in the `Wallpapers/<Desktop/Tablet/Mobile>` directory on GitHub.

Failure to adhere to this structure may result in your PR being rejected. **Consistency is key**!

# 🔢 *Issue Levels*

Issues in the project are categorized into levels, which determine the number of contributors required and the steps for resolution.

## **Level 1 Issues:**

- **Two contributors** can be assigned to these issues.
- Once both contributors submit their pull requests, the maintainers will review the work and select the best one to merge.
- If your PR is not selected, you will need to **reassign yourself to another issue**.

## **Level 2 Issues:**

- These issues also require **two contributors**.
- After reviewing both PRs, the best one will be merged. If your PR is not selected, you may wait for the maintainers to open a sub-issue for you or close the issue.
- If the issue is completely closed, you can reassign yourself to a different issue.

## **Level 3 Issues:**

- These are critical issues that require **three contributors**.
- Among the three contributors, the best submission will be selected, and the issue will go through a detailed review by the WallGodds team. If sub-issues are created during the review, they will be classified as **Level 2** issues, and the remaining two contributors can work on them following the Level 2 guidelines.
- Once the main issue is fully resolved, contributors may reassign themselves to other issues.

# 🌍 *Always Open Issues*

Some issues are **always open** and can be worked on at any time. These tasks are ongoing, and you are welcome to jump in whenever you wish.

## **🖼️ Design Wallpapers and Add Them to the Project #8**

- You are free to submit creative and new wallpapers at any time.  
- Simply submit your wallpaper along with a clear image and description.
- The wallpaper can be a photo you took or a piece of artwork you created.

## **🌱 Fix UI Bugs in the Website #4**

- If you notice any UI-related bugs or inconsistencies, feel free to fix them.  
- These issues are always open since UI improvements are always needed.

# 💡 *Important Notes*

## **1. Communication is Key**

Effective communication is essential. If you have any questions or need clarification, please feel free to ask! You can communicate through comments in your PR or the project discussions. Always keep communication lines open.

*Example*:  
- Comment in your PR: "I fixed the alignment of the buttons. Please review."
- If you're unsure: "I'm not sure if this wallpaper fits the theme. Could someone provide feedback?"

## **2. Respect Deadlines**

We work in a **timely manner**, so please make sure to submit your PRs by the given deadlines. If you need more time, inform the maintainers. This helps everyone stay organized and on track.

## **3. Focus on Quality, Not Quantity**

We prioritize **quality over quantity**. A small, well-written PR is far more valuable than a large, rushed one. Take your time to understand the issue, write clean code, and thoroughly test your changes.

*Example*:  
If you are fixing a bug, test it under different conditions to ensure it’s completely resolved.
